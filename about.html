                This is a website created for Web Page Design Spring 2025. I am a computer science 
                undergraduate student in my senior year. The classes I have enjoyed most in the past 
                were Intro to Game Design and Cybersecurity. I found that I actually really enjoyed 
                the Linux operating system during my time in Cybersecurity, so I want to try installing
                Linux on an old laptop that I have at home. In the future, I might even make Linux
                the operating system I use on my personal computer.
